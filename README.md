War card game program

Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game)

There is a lot of variation to the game, but in this program, we will stick with the following rules:

1. Two players with 26 cards for each person
2. The goal is to be the first player to win all 52 cards
3. At each round, both players will put down one card facing up. The player with the higher card takes both of the cards and moves them to their stack.
4. If two cards are played with equal value, hence 'war', both players place the next three cards face down and then another card face-up (Which goes back to step 3). 
    And if both cards have equual value again, repeat with another set of face-up/down cards, and so on.

5. Card rank (highest first)	A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2

 This is a game of **probability**
